# Flood-It

The aim of the game is to flood the board with one color, starting from the upper left corner. 
To recolor the active area, click on any of the neighboring squares. 
Colored circes only provide 50% of the points for the recolored titles. 
Depending on the size of the game board, double/triple/etc. number of points is reached after (nr of rows + nr of columns)/2 squares.
For example, for a 10x30 board, a bonus is activated after 20/40/60/etc. points.
